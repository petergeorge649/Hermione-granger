# Data
With a colossal sum of data accessible, we investigated a number of diverse sources. Hence CSV file was downloaded and prepared for the data analysisi. Using Python we were able to conduct various steps to reach the analyis and reporting stage. we scratched a number of diverse tables into Pandas Dataframes and began to investigate and clean the data. After finalizing with the data cleaning, we sent out the clean dataframes to CSV files to be utilized for assist investigation in SQL.

# Database
Investigating the data given and considering approximately how to interface it together, we use an ERD for how we needed our database to see and act. Utilizing MySQL, I made a modern pattern, and imported the CSV record from the  Python Jupyter notebook  which enabled us to go further with analysis.

# Visualisation
Through the use of Tableau we were  able to effectively envision distinctive  plots such as the distribution plots of different variables (independent and dependent) and creation of a visually appealing dashboard to represent the information.
