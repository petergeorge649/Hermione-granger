# Data

# Database
Investigating the data given and considering approximately how to interface it together, we use an ERD for how we needed our database to see and act. Utilizing MySQL, I made a modern pattern, and imported the CSV record from the  Python Jupyter notebook  which enabled us to go further with analysis.

# Visualisation
Through the use of Tableau we were  able to effectively envision distinctive  plots such as the distribution plots of different variables (independent and dependent) and creation of a visually appealing dashboard to represent the information.
